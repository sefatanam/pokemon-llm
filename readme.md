Perfect! I've successfully implemented a modern, scalable Pokemon card website with proper vanilla JavaScript architecture. Here's what I've built:

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Object-Oriented Design Patterns Implemented:**

1. **Singleton Pattern** - `PokemonAPI` service for API management
2. **Observer Pattern** - `EventEmitter` for decoupled communication
3. **Encapsulation** - Private fields using `#` syntax throughout
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Each class has single responsibility
5. **Factory Pattern** - `Pokemon` class creates instances from API data

### **File Structure:**
```
pokemon-llm/
├── index.html              # Main HTML with TailwindCSS
├── style.css               # Custom styles & animations
├── package.json            # Vite development setup
└── src/
    ├── main.js             # Application entry point
    ├── App.js              # Main controller class
    ├── models/
    │   └── Pokemon.js      # Pokemon data model
    ├── services/
    │   └── PokemonAPI.js   # API service with caching
    ├── components/
    │   └── PokemonCard.js  # Card rendering component
    ├── managers/
    │   ├── SearchManager.js # Search functionality
    │   └── LoadingManager.js # UI state management
    └── utils/
        └── EventEmitter.js  # Observer pattern implementation
```

## 🎨 **Features Implemented:**

- **Modern Card Design** - Glassmorphism effects with light green, purple, salmon theme
- **Search by Name** - Debounced search with real-time results
- **Responsive Grid** - Adaptive layout for all screen sizes  
- **Loading States** - Shimmer loading cards and error handling
- **Smooth Animations** - Hover effects and fade-in transitions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Ctrl+/ to focus search

## 🚀 **To Run:**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The architecture is perfectly scalable - you can easily add new features like favorites, detailed modals, filtering, or even turn it into a PWA. Each class is properly encapsulated and follows SOLID principles!
